\section{Bilateral Normal Filtering}
Their method considers normals as a surface signal defined over the original mesh.
This allows the design of a novel bilateral normal filter that depends on both spatial distance and signal distance.
Their bilateral normal filtering not only was used in a local, iterative scheme, but also in a global non-iterative scheme for isotropic denoising.

extremely noise,  feature preserving, irregular surface sampling.
