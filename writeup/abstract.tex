    The propagation filer is a novel filtering operator with the goal of filtering neighbor signal while preserving the important feature.
    On the other hand, it can minimize the expected difference between the filtered and desirable image outputs.
    Inspired by this techniques, we propose a novel mesh normal filtering framework based on the propagation filter with application in mesh denoising and smoothing(geometry texture removal).
    As the traditional mesh filtering, our framework also has two-stage process:
    first, we apply a particular 3D pattern to filter the face normals, using areal coordinates as the criterion of region segmentation;
    afterwards, the vertex positions are updated according to the filtered face normals.
    This pattern accelerates the algorithm of propagation filter and obtain even better results than shortest path.
    It performs well on a wide variety of meshes and is competitive with other state-of-the-art methods.

    %The Computational Visual Media Conference series, of which this is to be the first conference, is intended to provide a major new international forum for exchanging novel research ideas and significant %practical results both underpinning and applying Visual Media.
