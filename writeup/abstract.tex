    The bilateral filter is a classical filtering operator with the goal of preserving edge structure while smoothing signals.
    The reason it works is mainly on the spatial and range distances are enough close, but it ignores the local connections between signals.
    In this paper, we introduce a intrinsic filter method for 2D manifold surfaces.
    This approach builds the connections between desired signal and its neighbors shown in figure~\ref{Fig:relation}.
    Therefore, it has a outstanding power on filtering neighbor signal while preserving the important feature.
    A novel filtering framework based on our intrinsic filter is proposed with application in mesh denoising.
    As the traditional mesh filtering, our framework also has two-stage process:
    first, we apply geodesic path to build the face normal connections, then filter the face normals basing two different accumulative distance weights.
    afterwards, the vertex positions are updated according to the filtered face normals.
    For accelerating this process, we also introduce a simple, fast and effective pattern to replace the expend of using geodesic path
    It performs well on a wide variety of meshes and is competitive with other state-of-the-art methods.

    %The Computational Visual Media Conference series, of which this is to be the first conference, is intended to provide a major new international forum for exchanging novel research ideas and significant %practical results both underpinning and applying Visual Media.
